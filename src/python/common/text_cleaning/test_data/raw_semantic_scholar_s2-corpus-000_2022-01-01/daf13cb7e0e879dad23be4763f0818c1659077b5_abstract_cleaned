It is important to explore scale dependence in distributed physically-based hydrological model. Re-search on the effects of grid cell size and time step for seeking for the optimal modeling scale and modeling results would promise the accurate prediction of hydrological response to land use change and climate variabili-ty, and provide foundational basis for the scientific management of watershed. A calibrated hydrological model(MIKESHE) was applied to the Lv'ergou watershed in the Loess Plateau, to explore the effects of grid size and time step on model performance by using the method of multi-resolution validation. The results showed that grid cell size varied from 10m to 200m would make peak flow and total discharge simulation increase from 1.72m3/s to 8.56m3/s and 1.10×105m3 to 3.68×105m3 respectively. The changed characteristic of the watershed has assumed to explain the above simulation results. The relative changes in modeling area for 10m and 200m cell size modeling were -0.09% and 20.57% respectively, and 27.23% and 5.48% with respect to the relative of change in the length of river link. In addition, the reliance of water exchange simulation occurred between neighboring cells on the pixel size △x partly explain the change in modeling results. Generally, the grid cell size of 60 to 100m was believed to be appropriate for modeling purpose in this study. The change of time step has shown impact on peak flow simulation. With the increase of time step from 0.5h to 24h, peak flow was simulated as 2.38m3/s to 1.72m3/s resulting from the reduction of rainfall intensity. Since there existed lag discrepancy for the runoff recording for different time periods, it was difficult to carry out modeling task with an arbitrary time step for various time periods.
