OBJECTIVE
To investigate the effects of insulin on the expression of platelet membrane glycoprotein (GP) IIb/III a and its mechanism in normal subjects.


METHODS
Flow cytometry was used to detect the expression of the whole-blood platelet membrane GP b/ a. The respective effects of insulin, L-nitro-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) and methylene blue (MB) and their combination on the expression of GP b/ a were also studied.


RESULTS
Insulin had no effect on the expression of GP II b/III a in healthy subjects, but significantly inhibited the up-regulated expression of GP II b/III a induced respectively by thrombin and collagen. The inhibitory effects of insulin on thrombin- or collagen-induced expression of platelet membrane GP II b/III a were dose- and time-dependent, and could be completely blocked by L-NAME or methylene blue.


CONCLUSION
Insulin may inhibit the over-expression of platelet membrane GP IIb/III a by NOS-->NO-->GC-->GMP pathway.
