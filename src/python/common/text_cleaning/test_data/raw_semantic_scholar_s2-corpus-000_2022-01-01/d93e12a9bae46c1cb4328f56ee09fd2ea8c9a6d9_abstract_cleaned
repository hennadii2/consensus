Previous proposals for Distributed Deadlock Detection/Resolution algorithms for the AND model have the main disadvantage of resolving false deadlocks, that is, nonexisting or currently being resolved deadlocks. This paper provides an algorithm free of false deadlock resolutions, A simple specification for a safe deadlock resolution algorithm is introduced, and the new distributed solution is developed in a hierarchical fashion from its abstract specification. The algorithm is probe-based, uses node priorities, and coordinates the actions of resolvers so that false deadlocks are not resolved. The solution is formally proven correct by using the input-output Automata Model. Finally, a study about the liveness of the algorithm is provided.
