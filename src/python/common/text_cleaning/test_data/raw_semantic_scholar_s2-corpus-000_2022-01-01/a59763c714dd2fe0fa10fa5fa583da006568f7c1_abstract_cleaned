Abstract In this paper, an attempt has been made to study the global dynamical behavior of a viral dynamics model incorporating both the lytic and nonlytic immune responses. The global stability of the model is analyzed in terms of two threshold parameters, namely, basic reproduction number, R 0 and immune response reproduction number, R 1. The obtained results signify that the infection dies out if R 0 â‰¤ 1 and persists if R 0 > 1. We establish that the global dynamic behavior of the model has no concern with the efficacy of the nonlytic component. Numerical simulations are performed to support our theoretical findings and to investigate the effects of lytic and nonlytic components on the viral dynamics model. A comparison of two different viral infection models has been performed to illustrate the effect of viral replication inhibition through nonlytic effector mechanism on the infection dynamics. Moreover, a case study of HIV-1 infected humanized mice is presented and the result manifests that the model can fairly demonstrate the chronic stage of HIV-1 infection in humanized mice.
