Through studies of the revised draft and corresponding proposals on H.264/AVC fidelity range extension, the main new coding tools proposed for high fidelity range extension are analyzed and introduced in detail and in depth. Changes in the syntax of bitstream are pointed out, and suggestions on coding strategy at the coder end are put forward.
