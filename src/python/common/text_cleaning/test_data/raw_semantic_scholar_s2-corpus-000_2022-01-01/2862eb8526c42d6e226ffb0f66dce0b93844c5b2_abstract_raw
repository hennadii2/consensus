A systematic study using a model negative electrode slurry with poly(acrylic acid) as a binder is conducted aiming at the control of both dispersion quality and rheology in the electrode manufacturing process. Rheological properties of the model slurries vary considerably with the neutralization degree α. Optical microscope and Turbiscan measurements show that the rheological change is accompanied by the change in particle aggregation tendency. Adsorption and zeta potential measurements reveal that α-dependent adsorption of poly(acrylic acid) is the key factor that controls the rheology of the slurries. The difference in α of the slurry results in a significant difference in the surface roughness and the carbon black particle distribution in the electrode. From this study, it is concluded that the adjustment of neutralization degree of poly(acrylic acid)-based binder critically affects the heterogeneity of the electrode, which can influence the performance as well as the rheological stability in the electrode manufacturing process.
